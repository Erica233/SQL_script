# Project 3 - Fangting Ma

## INTRODUCTION

It is my 706 Project 3. I used a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stetsondone/video-game-sales-by-genre), which about different video games sales data. It contains sales data from 1980 to 2020 for different genres in different regions over the world.

Basically, my queries answers three questions about video games sales. They are useful for video games companies to decide their sales strategies about what genres of games to sale, what regions to focus on, and the development prospects of this industry.

The first query results show the total sales of video games in each year between 1980 and 2020 ordered from the nearest year.

The second query results show the total sales of video games for different genres, ordered by total sales, listing from the largest sales to the minimum.

The third query results show the total sales of video games in different regions, ordered by their total sales, listing from the largest sales to the minimum.

## IMPLEMENTATION

I created this new repo on github for my project 3 in a cloud development environment, Codespaces. I uploaded the dataset onto a cloud system, BigQuery. And I connected to the BigQuery. Then I wrote a script to carry out three query operations on this dataset. 

## HOW TO USE

```
python3 query.py 
```
Then the output will be printed out in the terminal.
